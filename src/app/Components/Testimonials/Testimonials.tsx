Rick designed a website from the ground up that is fully customizable and exactly what I needed. It was a pleasure to collaborate with him, and he was always willing to clearly explain the workflow and SEO properties in a language I could understand. He kept me apprised of how much time was spent building the site a regular basis so there were no surprises in the end. Thanks again Rick!`,
